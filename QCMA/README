QCMA is a cross-platform application to provide a Open Source
implementation of the original Content Manager Assistant that
comes with the PS Vita. QCMA is meant to be compatible with
Linux, Windows and MAC OS X.

By default QCMA is built using the qt4 library. If you want to 
build QCMA using the qt5 library, you have to launch the script 
by passing the QT5 parameter:

QT5=yes ./QCMA.SlackBuild

qt5 is an optional dependency.
